About this Fork
===============

I have no idea why development died some time ago, but I still use Miro, 
I still like it more than all other podcast players. But it's getting 
increasingly difficult to get it up and running.

Things I plan to do:
* Apply necessary patches to compile it
* Apply some bugfixes and patches I use on my version
* Try to change it to gstreamer-1.0
    (currently it requires webkit-gtk built without audio/video to run,
    gstreamer-1.0 from webkit collides with gstreamer-0.10 from miro)

And some maybe:
* use Python 3
* use newer webkit

What's here
===========

Miro
----

* ``tv``

  The centerpiece of the Miro platform, Miro is a desktop application
  that aims to make Internet TV an enjoyable experience for even the
  least technically sophisticated user.  Miro can view channels
  created with Broadcast Machine as well as a wide variety of other
  video sources on the Internet.  It also integrates with the remaining
  two components of the Miro platform: Channel Guide for promoting
  channels and Video Bomb for easy end-user republishing and social
  promotion of individual videos.

* ``docs``

  Developer documentation for Miro.

* ``resources``

  Scripts, packaging files, and a bunch of other stuff that helps
  us doing development on Miro and related projects.
